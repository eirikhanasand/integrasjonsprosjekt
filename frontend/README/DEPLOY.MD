Notes:
1. You can build for android first, if so do the steps relevant for Android first, then the iOS steps afterwards.
2. You can test using emulators, but physical devices are recommended as emulators gives limited functionality and can give bugs that are not present on physical devices.
3. Emulators do NOT support notifications.
